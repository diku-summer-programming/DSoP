# DIKU Summer of Programming 2021

This summer DIKU would like to support students at DIKU that would like maintain and improve their programming skills. Or just have some programming related fun with other students.

Programming is a a craft, like playing an instrument or using tools. You have during the course learned the basics of how it works. But if you lay it away over the summer (do not program or think problem solving in a programming context for two months) you will lose much of these skills that you have gain over the previous semester.

There exists many programming environments and open source communities, and we can recommend that you get involved with these. There are meet-ups around Copenhagen and some DIKU members are involved in [Coding Pirates](https://codingpirates.dk/). This is far from a complete list.

But it is also nice to collaborate and chat programming with fellow students. So with DIKU Summer of Programming we will try to make this easier. The material we are designing are targeting Bachelor's students between first and second year; i.e. students with a basic understanding of programming, that want to practice and slowly improve these skills.
But it is not limited to this. Anyone is welcome

We hope that it will be a fun and rewarding summer.
Jens, Joachim, Boris and Michael.

## Problem solving
When starting a programming problem, remember also what you have learned. We are not just programming for our own fun (though that is a big part of it); we are also programming for helping other with a solution or showing others how the problem can be solved.

Thus, remember the steps that you have learned
  * Analyse the problem: find the essence of the problem, reformulate the problem in your own words as you understand it (write it down)
  * Outline design: what can a solution to your problem be, outline this on a paper
  * Implement: translate your design into a solution. What did you not anticipate? Did you make some implementation related choices?
  * Testing: Does your solution work? Does it run as expected?
  * Documentation: Always document your work with both small texts and comment in the code. You might look at the problem later or others will look at it.


## First exercises

The following websites, has an extensive selection of small exercises regarding various topics in C#.

* https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/
* https://edabit.com/challenges/csharp

For small exercises and programming challenges there is also the possibility of using an existing platform, such as https://codewars.com/, that offers problems of increasing difficulty for the students to solve and test, and the possibility of comparing one's solution to other peoples solutions, etc. â€”  and it already has a community setup for answering questions.

## Projects

Once you have done some initial exercises, you might want to work on some larger projects. We provide a selection of projects below:

* [Project 0](projects/project0.pdf)
* [Project 1](projects/project1)
* [Project 2](projects/project2.pdf)

## Extended courses

If you need a break from programming we will recommend that you have a look at the following:

  * [The Linux/Unix terminal and its tools](terminal.md)

Alternatively (or supplementary), have a look at:

  * [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) that provide a somewhat easily digestible introduction to shell-scripting as well as a few other topics.

Or sit back and enjoy a couple of lectures from:

  * [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT.
