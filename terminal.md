## The Linux/Unix terminal and its tools
The terminal is a programmers friend! Being able to work from the terminal is an important skill for a programmer/computer scientist.

To start we will point you to [Over The Wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) which is a game that helps you get start.

For more expert use, we will point you to the notes from the former course on [Unix-like data processing](uldp17-2018-08-16.pdf).

### Make
Make is a widely used build system, with many purposes. We strongly recommend that you become familiar with it and it will also be useful in the future. There exists many manuals on the internet, but will suggest this one:
[https://oleks.github.io/compsys-archive/make.html](https://oleks.github.io/compsys-archive/make.html).
In the note on [Unix-like data processing](uldp17-2018-08-16.pdf) you can also find a detailed chapter.

### Shell Scripting
Throughout the course we will give you different shell scripts that can aid your testing of assignments and other tasks. A shell script is useful for automating a sequence commands into a single call. Later in the course it can be useful for you to update these scripts and create new ones based on the ones we have given; or just have the skills for making them in the future.

In the note on [Unix-like data processing](uldp17-2018-08-16.pdf) you can again find a chapter on shell scripting.
